### Introduction

Hello. My name is Kevin Witaszek and I am the author for the KX-023 Pedometer Sensor module build instructions for the Smart Watch project. The idea behind this project is to intergrate the pedometer sensor with an Arduino Pro Mini board. This sensor will work alongside a heart rate sensor module to build a smart watch which will be developed in the next semester with my partner Antonio Zuleta. Following the instructions below, you will create your own pedometer project which you can use for your own purposes. Let's begin.


### Items to purchase

The above list includes what you need to make this project possible. All of these parts(except the sensor) are available on Amazon and if you have Amazon Prime, you can save on shipping to make the price go down. The total for me was 112 CAD dollars. The sensor can be obtained from eletronic stores or websites from China. Please be aware that shipping from China can take long or short so please try to find the best deal possible.


### Total time for project

The above Gantt chart represents the schedule I used to schedule the steps i needed to work on the project.
COnsidering the user already pruchased and obtained all the items , the total time for making the project should be roughly around 10 hours .

### Assembly

As the first step in any hardware project, it is wise to start with setting up a prototype on a breadboard. This is required as we need to check if the parts work properly before we continue with the project. Please assemble the parts on the breadboard as shown below:
